# It is clear that this file does not try to search for the location 
# of the library, but knows it exactly because it is located in the 
# cmake subdirectory. We implemented this approach to connect all our 
# libraries in a uniform way. Both from the root files of the 
# repositories, and their use by external projects. In each case, it 
# is enough to add the path to the directory and start the search
